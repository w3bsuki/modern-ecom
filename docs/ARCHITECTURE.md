# System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural design of our e-commerce platform, including technologies, patterns, and key design decisions.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Rendering**: Hybrid (Server + Client Components)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Performance**: Dynamic imports, code splitting, and edge rendering

### Backend
- **API**: Next.js API Routes + Edge Functions
- **Data Sources**: External e-commerce API integration
- **Authentication**: [Planned]
- **Image Processing**: Next.js Image Optimization

## Architecture Principles

1. **Performance First**: Optimize for core web vitals and fast user experiences
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure functionality across all devices and networks
3. **Component Composition**: Build from small, reusable components
4. **Clear State Management**: Local state where possible, global state when necessary
5. **Maintainable Code**: Clear patterns, consistent formatting, and thorough documentation

## System Components

### Next.js App Router Structure

The application uses Next.js App Router with a file-system based routing:

```
src/
  app/
    layout.tsx          # Root layout with global providers
    page.tsx            # Homepage
    cart/               # Cart route
      page.tsx
    product/            # Product pages
      [slug]/
        page.tsx        # Dynamic product page
    collection/         # Collection pages
      [slug]/
        page.tsx        # Dynamic collection page
    wishlist/           # Wishlist route
      page.tsx
```

### Component Architecture

Components are organized by functionality and reusability:

```
src/
  components/
    ui/                 # Base UI components (shadcn/ui)
    layout/             # Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
    product/            # Product-specific components
    home/               # Homepage components
    shop/               # Shopping-related components
    theme/              # Theming components
```

### State Management

- **Local Component State**: React useState for component-specific state
- **Global State**: Zustand stores for:
  - Cart state
  - Wishlist state
  - UI state (modals, drawers, etc.)
  
### Data Flow

1. **Server Data Fetching**:
   - Products, collections, and metadata fetched on the server
   - Rendered with Server Components where possible
   - Streamed to the client using Suspense

2. **Client Interactions**:
   - Cart/wishlist operations managed client-side with Zustand
   - State persisted in localStorage
   - Real-time UI updates through React state

3. **Server Actions** (Planned):
   - Form submissions
   - Checkout processes
   - User authentication

## Performance Optimizations

### Server-Side Rendering
- Critical pages rendered on the server
- Data fetching at the server for improved performance
- HTML streaming for faster Time to First Byte

### Client-Side Optimizations
- Code splitting using dynamic imports
- Component lazy loading with suspense
- Image optimization with Next.js Image

### Edge Computing
- Collections page rendered at the edge
- Reduced latency for global users
- Faster response times

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Lighthouse CI

## Security Considerations

- Input sanitization for user inputs
- Authentication and authorization (planned)
- CORS and proper API security
- Content Security Policy implementation

## Future Architectural Enhancements

1. **Authentication System**:
   - User accounts and profiles
   - Social login integration
   - Persistent carts across devices

2. **Server Components Migration**:
   - Convert more components to Server Components
   - Reduce client JavaScript bundle

3. **API Expansion**:
   - Implement complete REST API
   - Consider GraphQL for complex data requirements

4. **Microservices Evolution**:
   - Split functionality into dedicated services
   - Implement API gateway pattern

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Next.js App Router?
- Modern React features (Server Components, Suspense)
- File-based routing simplicity
- Built-in optimization features
- Strong community support

### Why Zustand for State Management?
- Lightweight compared to Redux
- Simple API with minimal boilerplate
- Good performance characteristics
- Easy persistence with middleware

### Why Tailwind + shadcn/ui?
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design language
- Excellent performance with minimal CSS
- Highly customizable components
