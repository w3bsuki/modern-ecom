# Project Context & Current Focus

This document captures the current state of development, active focus areas, and important context for ongoing work. Update this document regularly as we shift focus between different parts of the project.

## Current Development Focus (Last Updated: Current Date)

We have successfully completed Phase 1 (UI/UX Refinement) and are now beginning work on Phase 2 (Cart & Wishlist Functionality).

### Active Tasks
- Implementing cart context provider
- Designing cart drawer component
- Setting up add-to-cart functionality

### Recent Accomplishments
- Completed all UI/UX refinements for Phase 1
- Enhanced hero section with split A/B testing design
- Implemented comprehensive product filtering
- Created responsive quick view functionality
- Ensured all components are mobile-friendly

## Important Context

### Project Structure
- Using Next.js App Router for routing
- Shadcn UI as base component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- TypeScript for type safety

### Current Pain Points
- None currently identified

### Development Decisions

#### State Management
We decided to use React Context for cart state management rather than a more complex solution like Redux or Zustand, as our needs are relatively straightforward and Context provides sufficient capabilities.

#### API Structure
We're using a combination of:
- Server Components for static/SSR data
- API Routes for dynamic data
- Server Actions for form submissions

#### Database Plans
We will implement Supabase in Phase 3 when we begin working on user authentication and account functionality.

## Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### Known Technical Debt
- None currently identified

### Performance Watch Areas
- Monitor bundle size as we add cart functionality
- Ensure skeleton loaders are properly implemented for cart-related components

### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure cart drawer is fully accessible with keyboard navigation
- Test cart interactions with screen readers

## Environment Notes
- Development is done using Next.js development server (`npm run dev`)
- Local environment should have appropriate `.env.local` configuration

## Meeting Notes & Decisions

- Quick view modal design approved with additional focus on mobile experience
- Product filtering system design finalized with support for multiple filter options
