## Technology Stack & UI Consistency

To ensure a cohesive, accessible, and polished user experience across all enhancements, we will strictly follow these technical guidelines:

### Component Library
- **shadcn/ui**: All new UI components will leverage the shadcn/ui component library for its accessibility, customizability, and consistent design language
- Custom components should follow shadcn/ui design patterns and maintain visual consistency

### Styling & Animation
- **Tailwind CSS**: All styling will use Tailwind utility classes with consistent application of spacing, colors, and responsive patterns
- **Framer Motion**: Animations and transitions will utilize Framer Motion for smooth, performant user interactions
- Motion should enhance the user experience without causing accessibility issues

### Implementation Standards
- Components should be responsive by default
- All components must maintain dark/light mode compatibility
- Interactive elements should have appropriate hover/focus/active states
- Animations should respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Follow ARIA best practices for accessibility

## Implementation Phases

Our enhancement plan is divided into five phases, each focusing on a specific area of the e-commerce experience. Each phase includes multiple features that can be implemented incrementally.

## Phase 1: Cart & Wishlist Improvements

Enhancing the already refactored cart and wishlist functionality with additional features for better user experience.

**Implementation Notes:**
