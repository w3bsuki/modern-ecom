# Medusa.js Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to integrate Medusa.js, an open-source headless commerce platform, into our existing e-commerce application. The goal is to replace our current mocked API and Supabase implementation with a more robust, commerce-focused backend solution.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Existing Components

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.0 with React 19
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (based on Radix UI)
- **State Management**: Zustand for cart and wishlist
- **Current Backend**: 
  - Supabase for authentication and data storage
  - Custom API implementation with mock data (`src/lib/api.ts`)

### Current Limitations

1. **Mock Data**: Currently using hard-coded product and collection data
2. **Limited E-commerce Features**: Missing robust inventory management, order processing, shipping options
3. **No Admin Dashboard**: Lacking administrative features for product management
4. **Manual Implementation**: Many e-commerce features are manually implemented

## Why Medusa.js?

1. **Open-Source**: Complete control and customization of the backend
2. **Headless Architecture**: Perfect for our Next.js frontend
3. **E-commerce Focused**: Built specifically for commerce with features like:
   - Product & inventory management
   - Order processing and fulfillment
   - Payment processing
   - Shipping options
   - Discount management
4. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extendable with plugins for various integrations
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Built-in admin interface
6. **REST API**: Well-documented API for frontend integration

## Integration Strategy

We'll take a phased approach to minimize disruption while migrating to Medusa.js.

### Phase 1: Setup & Proof of Concept (2-3 weeks)

1. **Install Medusa.js Backend**
   - Set up separate Medusa.js server
   - Configure database (PostgreSQL)
   - Test basic functionality
   
2. **Data Migration Planning**
   - Map our current product schema to Medusa's schema
   - Create data migration scripts
   
3. **Basic Integration Test**
   - Create simple product listing page using Medusa's API
   - Test basic cart operations with Medusa's API

### Phase 2: Core E-commerce Features (3-4 weeks)

1. **Product Management**
   - Migrate product data to Medusa
   - Update product listing pages to use Medusa's API
   - Implement product search and filtering with Medusa
   
2. **Cart & Checkout Flow**
   - Replace Zustand cart with Medusa cart API
   - Implement checkout flow using Medusa's checkout API
   - Add payment provider integration
   
3. **User Accounts**
   - Integrate Medusa's customer accounts
   - Migrate existing users from Supabase (if applicable)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Refinement (3-4 weeks)

1. **Order Management**
   - Implement order history for customers
   - Add order tracking functionality
   
2. **Advanced E-commerce Features**
   - Discounts and promotions
   - Shipping options
   - Tax calculation
   
3. **Admin Integration**
   - Set up Medusa admin dashboard
   - Configure permissions and roles
   - Train team on admin dashboard usage

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize API requests
   - Load testing and performance tuning

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Setup

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   npx create-medusa-app@latest
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Use PostgreSQL database
   - Migrate from Supabase to Medusa's database schema

3. **Medusa Plugin Integration**
   - File storage plugins (upload product images)
   - Payment provider plugins
   - Shipping provider plugins

### Frontend Integration

1. **API Client Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install @medusajs/medusa-js
   ```

2. **Replace Current API Functions**
   - Update `src/lib/api.ts` to use Medusa.js client
   - Create adapter functions to maintain compatibility with existing components

3. **Cart & Checkout Integration**
   - Replace Zustand cart state with Medusa cart
   - Implement server-side cart persistence

4. **Authentication Integration**
   - Replace Supabase auth with Medusa customer accounts
   - Implement auth token handling and storage

## Migration Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data migration errors | High | Create comprehensive test plans, run parallel systems during testing |
| API incompatibilities | Medium | Create adapter layer between frontend and Medusa API |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Performance testing at each phase, optimize as needed |
| Learning curve for team | Medium | Training sessions, documentation, start with simple implementations |
| Downtime during transition | High | Use feature flags, gradual rollout, maintenance window planning |

## Success Metrics

- All product data successfully migrated
- Cart and checkout flow working with real payment processing
- Admin dashboard operational for inventory management
- Performance matches or exceeds current implementation
- Expanded e-commerce features are available (shipping, taxes, discounts)

## Future Enhancements Post-Integration

1. Multi-currency support
2. Advanced inventory management
3. Customer loyalty program
4. Subscription-based products
5. Advanced analytics integration

## Timeline & Resources

- Total estimated time: 8-11 weeks
- Required resources:
  - Frontend developer(s) for API integration
  - Backend developer for Medusa configuration and customization
  - DevOps for server setup and deployment
  - QA for testing migration and new features
