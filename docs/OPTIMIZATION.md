# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the e-commerce application to improve rendering speed, reduce unnecessary re-renders, and enhance overall user experience.

## State Management Optimizations

### Zustand Store Optimization

We've restructured the Zustand stores (cart and wishlist) to:

1. **Separate concerns** - Split the stores into state, actions, and selectors for better organization
2. **Memoize derived values** - Calculate derived values more efficiently
3. **Implement selector hooks** - Created custom selector hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders

#### Cart Store Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Single access point causing unnecessary re-renders
const cart = useCart();
const { items, totalItems, subtotal } = cart;

// After: Selective access to only needed parts of state
const items = useCartItems();
const totalItems = useCartTotalItems();
const subtotal = useCartSubtotal();
const { addItem, removeItem } = useCartActions();
```

#### Wishlist Store Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Direct state access causing re-renders on any state change
const wishlist = useWishlist();
const { items, addItem, removeItem } = wishlist;
const itemCount = items.length;

// After: Optimized selectors to only update when relevant data changes
const items = useWishlistItems();
const itemCount = useWishlistItemCount();
const isInWishlist = useIsInWishlist(productId);
const { addItem, removeItem } = useWishlistActions();
```

## Component Optimizations

### ProductCard & ShopProductCard Components

1. **Memoized Derived Values**: Added `useMemo` to calculate derived product values like:
   - Discount percentages
   - Image sources
   - Formatted prices
   - State flags (isNew, isSale, etc.)

```typescript
const productDetails = useMemo(() => {
  const price = product.price || 0;
  const salePrice = product.salePrice;
  const discount = salePrice ? Math.round(((price - salePrice) / price) * 100) : null;
  // ... other calculations
  return { price, salePrice, discount, /* other values */ };
}, [product, isHovered]);
```

2. **Simplified Component Logic**: Reduced state updates and calculations during render

3. **Optimized Event Handlers**: Prevented unnecessary rerenders from event handlers

### CartDrawer & WishlistDrawer Components

1. **Selective State Access**: Only subscribe to the parts of state needed
2. **Optimized Rendering Logic**: Reduced UI complexity and conditional rendering
3. **Improved SSR/CSR Hydration**: Better handling of client/server rendering differences

## CSS & Styling Optimizations

1. **Improved Tailwind Usage**: More efficient class grouping with `cn()` utility
2. **Responsive Image Handling**: Better responsive image handling with proper sizing
3. **Transition Optimizations**: More targeted animation properties to reduce paint/layout operations

## General Best Practices Implemented

1. **Early Returns**: Using early returns for error conditions and loading states
2. **Client/Server Rendering**: Clear separation between server and client-side code
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with proper fallbacks

## Results & Benefits

- **Reduced Re-renders**: Components now re-render only when their specific data changes
- **Improved Performance**: Faster initial render and smoother interactions
- **Better Code Organization**: Clearer separation of concerns and component responsibilities
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: More predictable state management and component behavior

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Code Splitting**: Further splitting code into smaller chunks for more efficient loading
2. **Server Components**: Migration of more components to React Server Components where applicable
3. **Image Optimization**: Further optimization of image loading strategies
4. **Virtual Lists**: Implementation of virtualized lists for product grid views with many items
5. **Recently Viewed Enhancement**: Further optimization of the Recently Viewed component by:
   - Adding a configurable limit for the number of products stored
   - Implementing a time-based expiration for older items
   - Adding more metadata (like when the product was viewed)
   - Providing recommendations based on recently viewed products
