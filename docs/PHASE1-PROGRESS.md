## Technical Implementation Notes

### Component Architecture
The project follows a clean component architecture with reusable modules:
- Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- Product-related components (cards, grids, quick view)
- Layout components (header, footer, containers)
- Home components (hero, featured sections)

### Styling Approach
- Used Tailwind CSS with consistent spacing and color variables
- Created custom component variants through Shadcn UI
- Implemented responsive design using mobile-first approach
- Added subtle animations with Framer Motion

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized image delivery with proper sizing and formats
- Implemented skeleton loaders for data-dependent components
- Used code splitting for larger components
- Limited animations to enhance UX without impacting performance

## Lessons Learned
- Skeleton loaders significantly improve perceived performance
- Quick view functionality enhances the shopping experience without forcing page navigation
- Mobile filter drawers provide better UX than modals for complex filtering
- Split testing in the hero section allows for data-driven design decisions

## Next Steps
With Phase 1 completed, we'll move to Phase 2 (Cart & Wishlist Functionality) focusing on:
- Cart context implementation
- Add to cart functionality
- Cart drawer and page design
- Wishlist functionality
- Local storage persistence
