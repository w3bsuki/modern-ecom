## Technical Implementation Details

### Cart State Structure
```typescript
// Current Zustand implementation
interface CartItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  salePrice?: number | null;
  image: string;
  selectedSize: string | null;
  quantity: number;
}
```

### Wishlist State Structure
```typescript
// Zustand implementation for wishlist
interface WishlistStore {
  items: Product[];
  addItem: (item: Product) => void;
  removeItem: (id: string) => void;
  toggleItem: (item: Product) => void;
  clearWishlist: () => void;
}
```

### Current Implementation
We have successfully migrated from a Context-based implementation to a more efficient Zustand implementation:

1. âœ… Zustand-based implementation (`src/hooks/use-cart.tsx`) - Now used across all components
   - Uses Zustand for state management
   - Efficient storage (only necessary product data)
   - Built-in persistence with zustand/middleware
   - Better error handling and type safety
   - Better performance and developer experience
   - Toast notifications for all cart actions

2. âœ… Zustand-based wishlist implementation (`src/hooks/use-wishlist.tsx`)
   - Similar pattern to cart implementation
   - Toggle functionality for adding/removing items
   - Full persistence with zustand/middleware
   - Integrated with all product components

### Local Storage Strategy
- âœ… Save cart to localStorage on every change
- âœ… Load cart from localStorage on app initialization
- âœ… Data validation to prevent errors from corrupted storage
- âœ… Same persistence strategy for wishlist data

### UI Components Implemented
- âœ… CartDrawer (slide-in cart)
- âœ… CartPage (full-page cart)
- âœ… QuantitySelector (embedded in cart components)
- âœ… AddToCartButton (on product pages)
- âœ… Toast Notifications (feedback for cart actions)
- âœ… QuickView Add-to-Cart (quick product view with cart functionality)
- âœ… WishlistToggle (heart icon with toggle state)
- âœ… WishlistDrawer (slide-in wishlist panel)
- âœ… WishlistGrid (full wishlist page)

## Progress Updates
- Initial cart context and persistence implemented
- Cart drawer component with animations complete
- Full cart page with responsive design implemented
- Add to cart functionality working from product pages
- Safe handling of invalid products to prevent errors
- Successfully migrated to Zustand-based cart implementation
- All related components updated to use new cart store
- Deleted old context-based implementation after validation
- Removed CartProvider from layout/root component
- Added toast notifications for all cart actions (add/remove/update)
- Implemented quick view add-to-cart functionality

## Refactoring Status
See [CART-REFACTORING.md](./CART-REFACTORING.md) for detailed progress on cart refactoring.

## Next Immediate Tasks

2. âœ… Implement quick view add-to-cart
3. âœ… Begin wishlist functionality using Zustand pattern
4. âœ… Add "Recently Viewed" section on product pages
