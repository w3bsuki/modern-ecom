# E-Commerce Refactoring Progress

## Overview

This document tracks our progress in refactoring the e-commerce platform, following the plan outlined in REFACTORING-PLAN.md.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Code Structure Improvements

1. **Refactored ProductDetail Component** ✅
   - Extracted product gallery to a separate component
   - Extracted product information section
   - Extracted product actions (add to cart, wishlist, etc.)
   - Implemented proper prop drilling

2. **Improved Hook Organization** ✅
   - Enhanced cart store implementation with proper hydration handling
   - Enhanced wishlist store implementation with improved patterns
   - Added safe client-side access hooks
   - Created consistent selector hooks
   - Added backward-compatibility hooks for smooth migration

3. **Standardized Cart/Wishlist Components** ✅
   - Created shared drawer component foundation (ShopDrawer)
   - Created reusable EmptyState component
   - Standardized item display patterns
   - Applied consistent patterns across cart and wishlist drawers

### In Progress

1. **Optimize Store Subscriptions**
   - Use fine-grained selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Implement proper memo/useMemo patterns
   - Add event-based updates for cross-component communication

### Next Steps

1. **Improve Hydration Handling**
   - Implement proper SSR-safe code
   - Use dynamic imports for client-only components
   - Add proper skeleton states during hydration

2. **UX Improvements**
   - Add better loading states
   - Implement smooth transitions and animations
   - Provide clearer feedback for actions

## Technical Improvements Made

### Store Implementation

- **Improved Hydration Handling**: Added proper isInitialized state for both cart and wishlist stores
- **Safer Client Rendering**: Created useSafeCart and useSafeWishlist hooks for safe client-side access
- **Optimized Selectors**: Implemented more efficient selectors to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Improved type definitions for cart and wishlist items
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized store implementation patterns across cart and wishlist
- **Backward Compatibility**: Added compatibility hooks for smooth migration to new API patterns

### Component Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Split ProductDetail into focused components:
  - ProductGallery: Handles image display and gallery functionality
  - ProductInfo: Displays product details and information
  - ProductActions: Handles cart and wishlist interactions
- **Reusable Components**: Designed components to be more reusable across the application
  - ShopDrawer: Shared drawer component for both cart and wishlist
  - EmptyState: Reusable empty state component with customizable content
- **Reduced Size**: Significantly reduced component size (ProductDetail.tsx from ~829 lines to a manageable size)
- **Consistent API**: Created consistent prop patterns across related components
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed React key issues in AnimatePresence components to prevent duplicate key errors

### Code Quality

- **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error handling with toast notifications
- **Better TypeScript Usage**: Enhanced type definitions and interfaces
- **Consistent Naming**: Standardized naming conventions across the codebase
- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated duplicated code through shared components

### Future Improvements

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Lazy load cart and wishlist drawers
   - Implement dynamic imports for better performance

2. **UX Improvements**
   - Add better loading states
   - Implement smooth transitions and animations
   - Provide clearer feedback for actions

3. **Accessibility**
   - Improve accessibility for all components
   - Add proper aria attributes and keyboard navigation

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Hydration Issues
**Solution**: Implemented skipHydration in Zustand persist middleware and created safe access hooks with isMounted checks.

### Challenge: Inconsistent Cart/Wishlist Patterns
**Solution**: Standardized the implementation of both stores, creating a consistent pattern for state management.

### Challenge: Oversized Components
**Solution**: Split large components into smaller, focused ones with clear responsibilities.

### Challenge: Duplicated UI Logic
**Solution**: Created shared UI components like ShopDrawer and EmptyState to eliminate duplication.

## Next Milestone: Performance Optimization (Target: End of Week)

- Implement code splitting for cart/wishlist functionality
- Add proper skeleton loading states
- Optimize re-renders across the application
- Improve animation and transitions
