# E-Commerce Platform Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of our e-commerce platform, including technologies, patterns, design decisions, and planned improvements.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3 (App Router)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS 4.1
- **State Management**: Zustand 5.0
- **Animation**: Framer Motion 12.9 (minimal usage)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Performance**: Server Components, Edge Functions, Image Optimization

### Backend (Planned)
- **API**: Next.js API Routes + Edge Functions
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Content Management**: CMS integration (TBD)

## Architectural Principles

1. **Performance-First**: Optimize for core web vitals and fast user experiences
2. **Component-Based Design**: Build from small, reusable, well-typed components
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure functionality across all devices and networks
4. **Maintainability**: Clear patterns, consistent structure, thorough documentation
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a minimum standard

## System Components

### Application Structure

```

      ...

    stores/                 # Zustand stores
    data/                   # Data fetching utilities
    utils/                  # Helper functions
    supabase/               # Supabase client
    
  hooks/                    # Custom React hooks
  
  types/                    # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Component Architecture

We follow a component-based architecture with these categories:

1. **UI Components**: Base components from shadcn/ui, extended as needed
2. **Layout Components**: Page structure components (Header, Footer, etc.)
3. **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components for shopping features
4. **Page Components**: Components specific to certain pages
5. **Composite Components**: Components that combine multiple components

### State Management

#### Client-Side State with Zustand
We use Zustand for client-side state management with these stores:

1. **Cart Store**: `src/lib/stores/cart-store.ts`
   - Manages cart items and operations
   - Persisted with localStorage

2. **Wishlist Store**: `src/lib/stores/wishlist-store.ts`
   - Manages wishlist items and operations
   - Persisted with localStorage

3. **UI Store**: `src/lib/stores/ui-store.ts`
   - Manages UI state like modals, drawers, etc.
   - Not persisted between sessions

#### Server-Side State
- Server Components for data fetching
- API Routes for dynamic operations
- Future: Server Actions for form submissions

### Data Flow

#### Client-Side Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger Zustand store actions
2. Store updates trigger React component re-renders
3. Changes persist to localStorage where appropriate

#### Server-Side Data Flow
1. Server Components fetch data during rendering
2. Data is streamed to the client with Suspense
3. Dynamic data fetched through API Routes

### Rendering Strategy

We implement a hybrid rendering approach:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - Used for initial page loads
   - Improves SEO and performance

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
   - Used for stable content like collection pages
   - Improves performance and reduces server load

3. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
   - Used for product pages
   - Balances performance with content freshness

4. **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**
   - Used for highly interactive components
   - Cart, wishlist, and personalized components

5. **Edge Rendering**
   - Used for dynamic but cacheable components
   - Collections pages with filtering

## Performance Optimizations

### Server-Side Optimizations
- Server Components for reduced client JavaScript
- Streaming and Suspense for improved time to first byte
- Edge Functions for reduced latency
- Static generation for stable content

### Client-Side Optimizations
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Font optimization with next/font
- Image optimization with next/image
- Skeleton loaders for perceived performance
- Prefetching for anticipated user journeys

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking unused code
- Dynamic importing of large components
- Minimal client-side JavaScript with Server Components
- Careful dependency management

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Vercel Integration
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse CI

## Security Considerations

- Input validation with Zod
- API routes with proper authentication
- Content Security Policy implementation
- HTTPS enforcement
- Supabase RLS policies (planned)

## Future Architectural Enhancements

### Phase 3: Authentication & User Accounts
- Implement Supabase authentication
- Create protected routes
- Develop user profile management
- Sync client-side state with server

### Phase 4: Checkout & Payment
- Implement checkout flow
- Integrate payment processors
- Develop order management
- Create email notification system

### Phase 5: Admin & Content Management
- Build admin dashboard
- Implement product management
- Create content management system
- Develop analytics dashboard

## Architectural Decisions

### Why Next.js App Router?
- Modern React features (Server Components, Suspense)
- File-based routing simplicity
- Built-in performance optimizations
- Hybrid rendering options

### Why Zustand over Context or Redux?
- Simpler API with less boilerplate
- Better performance than Context API
- Built-in persistence middleware
- Smaller bundle size than Redux

### Why shadcn/ui?
- Unstyled, accessible components
- Full control over styling
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Copy-paste approach for customization

## Monitoring & Evaluation

We monitor application performance through:
- Lighthouse scores for Core Web Vitals
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) through Vercel Analytics
- Error tracking and logging
- Performance budgets for critical pages
