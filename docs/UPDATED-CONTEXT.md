# Project Context & Current Development Focus

This document captures the current state of development, active focus areas, and important context for ongoing work. It serves as a quick reference for anyone working on the project.

## Current Development Focus

We are currently in **Phase 2: Cart & Wishlist Functionality**. Having completed the core shopping experience in Phase 1, we're now focused on implementing a complete cart and wishlist system.

### Active Tasks
- Implementing cart functionality with Zustand state management
- Creating cart drawer component with shadcn/ui
- Setting up "add to cart" animations and confirmations
- Developing wishlist toggle and management
- Ensuring persistence of cart and wishlist data

### Recent Accomplishments
- Completed core shopping experience (Phase 1)
- Implemented responsive product listings with filtering
- Created detailed product pages with variant selection
- Developed quick view functionality
- Optimized performance for core components

## Technical Context

### Project Structure
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (used sparingly)
- **Performance**: Server Components, dynamic imports, image optimization

### State Management
We've moved from React Context to Zustand for state management due to:
- Better performance characteristics
- Simpler API with less boilerplate
- Built-in persistence through middleware
- Better developer experience with Redux DevTools integration

The cart and wishlist stores are implemented in:
- `src/lib/stores/cart-store.ts`
- `src/lib/stores/wishlist-store.ts`

### Component Architecture
Components are organized following a structural pattern:
- `src/components/ui/` - Base UI components (shadcn/ui)
- `src/components/layout/` - Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
- `src/components/product/` - Product-specific components
- `src/components/home/` - Homepage components
- `src/components/shop/` - Shopping-related components
- `src/components/theme/` - Theme-related components

## Development Guidelines

### Performance Guidelines
- Use Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Minimize client-side JavaScript with selective hydration
- Optimize images using Next.js Image component
- Use dynamic imports for larger components
- Implement skeleton loaders for content

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation
- Maintain consistent spacing using the spacing scale
- Follow the design system for colors, typography, and components

### State Management Guidelines
- Use local state for component-specific state
- Use Zustand for global state (cart, wishlist, UI state)
- Implement persistence for user-related state
- Keep store logic separate from UI components

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment
- Next.js development server: `npm run dev`
- Performance analysis: `npm run analyze`
- Lighthouse testing: `npm run lighthouse`

### Required Environment Variables
- See `.env.local.txt` for required environment variables
- Create a `.env.local` file with appropriate values

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- Ensuring cart persistence across sessions
- Optimizing performance for cart/wishlist operations
- Managing loading states for cart interactions

### UX Considerations
- Providing clear feedback for cart/wishlist actions
- Ensuring mobile-friendly cart experience
- Handling edge cases (out of stock, quantity limits)

## Next Steps After Current Phase

Once we complete Phase 2 (Cart & Wishlist), we'll move to:

### Phase 3: User Authentication & Accounts
- Implement Supabase authentication
- Create user profile pages
- Develop account management functionality
- Sync cart/wishlist with user accounts
