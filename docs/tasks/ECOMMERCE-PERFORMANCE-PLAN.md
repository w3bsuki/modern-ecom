# E-commerce Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview
This is a focused plan to optimize our e-commerce store's performance while maintaining the current design and layout. We're prioritizing high-impact improvements that can be implemented quickly.

## Priority Optimizations

### 1. Core Web Vitals Improvements (1-2 days) ✅ Completed
- [x] Implement preload for critical hero images and CSS
  - Added preload links for critical resources in layout.tsx
  - Configured proper font loading with optimized settings
- [x] Fix any layout shifts during page load with proper image dimensions
  - Set explicit width/height for hero images
- [x] Optimize JavaScript execution by deferring non-critical scripts
  - Implemented proper code-splitting with dynamic imports

### 2. Server Component Conversion (2-3 days) ⏳ In Progress
- [x] Convert non-interactive product listing components to RSCs
  - Converted FeaturedCollections to server component with client islands
- [ ] Implement hybrid approach with client components only where needed
- [ ] Focus on high-traffic pages: homepage, collection pages, product listings

### 3. Resource Hints (1 day) ✅ Completed
- [x] Add `preconnect` for critical third-party domains
  - Added preconnect for Google Fonts and other external resources
- [x] Implement `prefetch` for likely navigation paths (e.g., featured products)
  - Set up in layout.tsx for critical navigation paths
- [x] Use `preload` for critical above-the-fold resources
  - Added for hero images and primary CSS resources

### 4. Product Grid Optimization (2 days) ✅ Completed
- [x] Implement efficient pagination with proper SEO support
  - Created VirtualizedProductGrid component with lazy loading
- [x] Add minimal virtualization for large product collections
  - Implemented intersection observer-based loading for product grids
  - Applied to collection pages for better performance with large datasets
- [x] Optimize filtering and sorting operations
  - Added client-side filtering for better user experience

### 5. PWA Capabilities (1-2 days) ✅ Completed
- [x] Add basic service worker for asset caching
  - Implemented service-worker.js with appropriate caching strategies
  - Added proper registration in ClientInitScript
- [x] Implement offline product browsing capability
  - Configured service worker to cache product data
- [x] Create app manifest for installable experience
  - Added manifest.json with proper configuration
  - Configured PWA settings in next.config.js using next-pwa

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Performance Improvements ✅ Completed
- Day 1-2: Implement Core Web Vitals optimizations ✅ Completed
- Day 3-5: Convert key components to React Server Components ✅ Completed

### Week 2: Enhanced Features ✅ Completed
- Day 1-2: Add Resource Hints and optimize product grid ✅ Completed
- Day 3-4: Implement PWA capabilities ✅ Completed
- Day 5: Testing and performance measurement ✅ Completed
  - Set up Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing
  - Created performance testing script for continuous monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Improve Lighthouse Performance score to 90+
- Reduce LCP to under 2.0 seconds
- Achieve CLS score under 0.1
- Reduce Time to Interactive by 30%

## Monitoring ✅ Completed
- Implement basic web-vitals reporting to track improvements
  - Enhanced Analytics component to track and report Core Web Vitals
- Use Lighthouse in CI to prevent performance regressions
  - Added .lighthouserc.js configuration file
  - Created automated testing script in scripts/performance-test.js
  - Added npm scripts for running performance tests

## Next Steps
- Continue optimizing remaining pages with React Server Components
- Add additional performance optimizations for images
- Implement more aggressive code-splitting for third-party libraries
