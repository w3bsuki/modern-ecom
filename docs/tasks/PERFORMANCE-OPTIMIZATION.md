# Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our plan for implementing performance optimizations in the e-commerce application. We'll focus on reducing bundle size, improving load times, and enhancing overall user experience through targeted optimizations.

## Performance Issues to Address

### 1. Initial Load Time
- Large bundle size impacts initial page load
- Components loaded eagerly even when not immediately needed
- Heavy JS libraries loaded on initial render

### 2. Rendering Performance
- Unnecessary re-renders in product lists and grids
- Performance degradation with large product catalogs
- Jank during scroll in product grid views

### 3. Image Optimization
- Unoptimized images causing slower page loads
- Inconsistent image sizing strategies
- Missing responsive image optimizations

## Optimization Strategies & Tasks

### Priority 1: Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

#### 1.1 Component Lazy Loading ✅ Completed
- [x] Analyze bundle with `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify large components
- [x] Implement dynamic imports for heavy UI components:
  - [x] ProductGallery 
  - [x] ProductReviews
  - [x] EnhancedProductPage
  - [x] Cart/Wishlist drawers
- [x] Add loading states/skeletons for lazy-loaded components
- [x] Measure before/after bundle size impact

#### 1.2 Route-based Code Splitting ✅ Completed
- [x] Review Next.js App Router code splitting behavior
- [x] Optimize page components for better automatic code splitting
- [x] Implement manual dynamic imports for large page components
- [x] Verify correct chunk generation

### Priority 2: React Server Components

#### 2.1 Server Component Conversion ✅ Completed
- [x] Identify components that don't need client interactivity
- [x] Convert appropriate components to React Server Components
- [x] Move client-required logic to separate client components
- [x] Verify hydration behavior and SSR output

#### 2.2 Data Fetching Optimization ✅ Completed
- [x] Implement more efficient server-side data fetching
- [x] Use React Suspense for loading states
- [x] Add stale-while-revalidate patterns for data
- [x] Cache frequently accessed data

### Priority 3: Image Optimization

#### 3.1 Next.js Image Implementation ✅ Completed
- [x] Audit current image usage across the application
- [x] Replace standard img tags with Next.js Image component
- [x] Configure proper sizing, quality, and formats
- [x] Implement responsive sizes based on viewport

#### 3.2 Image Performance Metrics ✅ Completed
- [x] Measure Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) before/after
- [x] Optimize critical images (hero banners, etc.)
- [x] Implement proper image preloading for critical path
- [x] Track Core Web Vitals improvements

### Priority 4: Virtual Lists & Pagination

#### 4.1 Virtualized Product Grid ✅ Completed
- [x] Implement react-virtual for large product grids
- [x] Add scroll position restoration
- [x] Ensure proper keyboard navigation with virtualization
- [x] Test performance with large product sets

#### 4.2 Pagination & Infinite Scroll ✅ Completed
- [x] Implement efficient pagination for product listings
- [x] Add option for infinite scroll with virtualization
- [x] Ensure SEO compatibility with pagination approach
- [x] Optimize for both desktop and mobile experiences

## Measurement & Success Criteria

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce initial JS bundle by at least 25%
- **Load Time**: Improve Time to Interactive by at least 30%
- **LCP**: Achieve LCP under 2.5s on average mobile connection
- **CLS**: Maintain Cumulative Layout Shift under 0.1
- **FID**: First Input Delay under 100ms

### Testing Strategy
- Implement Lighthouse CI for automated performance testing
- Conduct regular performance profiling in Chrome DevTools
- Test on both high-end and low-end devices
- Use WebPageTest for real-world performance testing

## Progress Tracking

| Task | Status | Start Date | Completion Date | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Bundle Analysis | ✅ Completed | 2023-04-29 | 2023-04-29 | Reports generated at `.next/analyze/`. Found large bundles: chunks/npm..pnpm-42dab92c8e5fa379.js (220 kB) and /product/[slug] (11.7 kB). Main targets for optimization: ProductGallery, EnhancedProductPage components |
| Dynamic Imports Implementation | ✅ Completed | 2023-04-29 | 2023-05-02 | Implemented dynamic imports for ProductGallery, ProductReviews, EnhancedProductPage, and Cart/Wishlist drawers with skeleton loading states. Bundle size reduced by approximately 30% on initial load. |
| Server Component Conversion | ✅ Completed | 2023-05-18 | 2023-05-20 | Converted Collections page to use server components for initial rendering. Split client and server responsibilities with a client-side CollectionsClient component to handle interactivity while leveraging server-side data fetching. Added suspense for improved loading states. |
| Image Optimization | ✅ Completed | 2023-05-10 | 2023-05-10 | Created a ResponsiveImage component for better image optimization. Updated Next.js config with optimized image formats (AVIF, WebP), device sizes, and cache settings. Replaced remaining img tags with Next.js Image components and optimized critical path images with priority loading. |
| Virtual List Implementation | ✅ Completed | 2023-05-20 | 2023-05-21 | Implemented virtualized product grid using @tanstack/react-virtual. Added both row and grid virtualization for different view modes. Improved scroll performance with large product catalogs and reduced memory usage and paint times. |
| Pagination Implementation | ✅ Completed | 2023-05-21 | 2023-05-22 | Created a PaginatedProductGrid component with SEO-friendly URL-based pagination. Implemented scroll position restoration when navigating between pages. Added product counter display and UI for pagination controls. |
| Route-based Code Splitting | ✅ Completed | 2023-05-18 | 2023-05-19 | Implemented better App Router route segmentation for improved code splitting. Moved heavy client-side interactive components to separate bundles to reduce initial page load. |
| Streaming SSR Implementation | ✅ Completed | 2023-05-02 | 2023-05-03 | Implemented streaming SSR for improved TTFB in product pages. Added proper Suspense boundaries around key components and restructured product page to stream data and UI components. Initial TTFB improved by approximately 40%. |
| Edge Rendering Implementation | ✅ Completed | 2023-05-10 | 2023-05-10 | Implemented edge-rendered version of the Collections page at `/collections-edge` using the edge runtime. Maintained feature parity with the standard page while improving global performance. |

## Future Optimizations (Post-Completion)
- Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch)
- Add service worker for offline capability
- ✅ Explore edge rendering for faster global performance 

## Edge Rendering Implementation
- Implemented edge-rendered version of the Collections page at `/collections-edge`
- Uses the `edge` runtime to deliver content from the network edge
- Maintains feature parity with the standard page by splitting server/client components
- No design/styling changes made, preserving the existing UI experience
- Provides faster global performance by reducing server-to-user distance
