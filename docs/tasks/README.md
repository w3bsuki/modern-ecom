# Task Management System

This directory contains detailed task plans for major features, optimizations, and refactoring efforts. Each task plan follows a standardized structure to ensure consistency and thorough planning.

## Task Plan Structure

Each task plan document should include:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the task and its goals
2. **Problem Statement**: What issues or requirements are we addressing?
3. **Proposed Solution**: Detailed approach to solving the problem
4. **Task Breakdown**: Specific steps with checkboxes for tracking progress
5. **Success Criteria**: How we'll measure successful completion
6. **Progress Tracking**: Table for documenting status updates
7. **Dependencies**: Any external factors or prerequisites
8. **Future Considerations**: Notes for post-completion follow-ups

## Status Indicators

We use the following status indicators throughout task documents:

- ‚è≥ Not Started
- ‚è±Ô∏è In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- üîÑ Under Review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked

## Current Tasks

| Task | File | Status | Priority |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| Performance Optimization | [../optimizations/PERFORMANCE.md](../optimizations/PERFORMANCE.md) | ‚è±Ô∏è In Progress | High |
| Cart & Wishlist Features | [../features/CART-WISHLIST.md](../features/CART-WISHLIST.md) | ‚úÖ Complete | High |
| Upcoming E-Commerce Features | [../features/UPCOMING-FEATURES.md](../features/UPCOMING-FEATURES.md) | ‚è≥ Not Started | Medium |

## Documentation Structure

For a complete overview of the project and documentation, please refer to:
- [Master Plan](../MASTER-PLAN.md) - Overall project roadmap
- [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - System architecture and design
- [Development Guide](../guides/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md) - Coding standards and practices

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: New task plans are created before implementation begins
2. **Execution**: Tasks are updated regularly during implementation
3. **Completion**: Tasks are marked complete when all criteria are met
4. **Archive**: Completed task documents may be archived but are preserved for reference

## Best Practices

- Update task status regularly during implementation
- Break down large tasks into manageable chunks
- Include specific, actionable subtasks with clear completion criteria
- Document blockers and dependencies as they arise
- Cross-reference related tasks when appropriate
